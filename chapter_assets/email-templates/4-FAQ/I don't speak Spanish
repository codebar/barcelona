Hi XXX,

In the Barcelona chapter the main communication language is English. In the workshops, once the student are working with a coach they might switch to any language that is better to them. 

So you are welcome to the Barcelona chapter even if you don't speak Spanish or Catalan!

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,

XXX
