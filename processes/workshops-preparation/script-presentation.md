# Script for the introduction talk given by the MC

This is meant as a guide to help you prepare for the MC (master of ceremonies) role. Feel free to customize the points below.

* Welcome everyone
* I am <your name>, I am a ... and one of the organizers of codebar Barcelona.
* Introduce the other codebar barcelona chapter organizers present and not present.
* Welcome any new members (on the codebar.io page there is a small paw icon next to the name of new members).
* Present codebar, what we want and how we plan to achieve it (Codebar is a UK based charity. We now have chapters all across the world. The mission of codebar is to help underrepresented groups learn to program in a safe and collaborative environment.)
* Slack channel: explain that we have a slack channel. People should join the Barcelona channel. We let people who are in the Barcelona slack RSVP for workshops 1 day before sending the invitations out to the general public. We also have a #barcelona-social and a #helpdesk channel where people can get help in between workshops.  
* For in person workshops thank the <host>. The host can say a few words.
* Explain how the workshop will work. For virtual events, let people know that we will send an alert a few minute before the workshop ends, and that we will take a picture at the end.
* Thank Coaches
* Thank Student

* Announcements: upcoming workshops, any events happening at the global level etc.
* Explain code of conduct: Even though this is a virtual event, we still abide by the code of conduct. We are very passionate about the code of conduct, and creating a safe space for all participants is really important to us. If you feel there has been a violation you can reach out to any of the organizers, either through the slack channel, or we will be available here in zoom. We will also link a copy of the [code of conduct](https://codebar.io/code-of-conduct) in the chat channel.
