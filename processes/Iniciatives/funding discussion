Funding

Should we look for funding for barcelona chapter?

# pros

* means to do some local stuff:
 * perks
  * stickers
  * permanent nametags
  * ...
 * be present at other events
 * invite other organizers here at bcn ( or vice-versa)
 * ...
* hosting codebar has some value that goes beyond the fact of helping our cause.
* scholarship? help some students in gettting courses, laptop... (study first what they
need but asking some students if we could have help them in this matter)
* some companies want to help and hosting is not always possible


# cons

* will need to manage it, and be responsible openly and transparently on its use
* create a budget..., more work
* lose our independence. the current format works really well without having to take 
into account financial matters. Does the works that will be needed is greater than the value 
we will generate? Why not just search for sponsors on some specific project?
